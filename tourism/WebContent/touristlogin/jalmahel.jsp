<h4>
Possibly the most serene sight amidst the chaos of Jaipur is the beautiful Jal Mahal Jaipur, the Water Palace. This low-rise symmetrical palace, that once was a shooting lodge for the Maharajah, appears to float in the centre of Sagar Lake. The light sand coloured stone walls of the Jal Mahal Jaipur are at a stark contrast to the deep blue of the waters of the lake, while from the innards of the palace lush foliage sprouts.
The Jal Mahal is 4km to the north of Jaipur and is located on the main Amer-Jaipur road. Most visitors to the Jal Mahal combine the visit with the Amer fort as both attractions are on the same side of Jaipur. A typical visit to the Jal Mahal will be less than 30 minutes, enough time to take some photos. There used to be gondolas which would provide romantic boat rides across the lake but these rides stopped 3 years ago. Apart from the small market stalls and camel rides there is not much else to do at the Jal Mahal.
A rickshaw from Jaipur to Jal Mahal will cost between 50-100RS while the return journey should cost less than 150RS. A one day rickshaw tour that includes the Amer fort, the Jal Mahal and the monkey temple will cost around 500Rs. The Jal Mahal is connect to Jaipur by bus (bus number 5 and AC1) and the palace is on the main route between Jaipur and Amer. A single bus ticket from Jaipur will cost 10Rs and buses depart from Ajmeri gate.
